# Dinou v9.0.3 — Rigorous Executive Summary & Architectural Verification Matrix

This document provides an executive summary of the **Dinou v9.0.3** architecture, its multi-dimensional rendering and caching engine, the 3D Continuous Integration verification matrix, and the exhaustive End-to-End (E2E) test coverage implemented in `e2e/example.spec.ts`.

---

## 1. Framework Stability & 3D CI Verification Matrix

Passing 100% of the GitHub Actions CI pipeline across all workflows confirms that Dinou's rendering, caching, streaming, and client reconciliation engines behave deterministically under real browser execution. Every E2E test runs under a **strict console and page-error sentinel** that immediately fails on any React 19 hydration mismatch, unhandled exception, or unexpected runtime error.

Dinou is continuously verified across a **three-dimensional compatibility matrix**:

### 1.1. Four Server & Edge Runtimes
1. **Node.js**: Dual-Engine ESM/CJS runtime architecture backed by `FileSystemStorage` (`.dinou/dist2`).
2. **Bun**: Native high-throughput JavaScript runtime backed by `FileSystemStorage`.
3. **Deno / Deno Deploy**: Native `Deno.serve` Edge runtime backed by `DenoKVStorage` (with automatic atomic chunking and reassembly for payloads `> 16 KB` and build-time KV seeding via `seed-kv.js`).
4. **Cloudflare Workers**: `workerd` Edge runtime with in-memory Virtual File System (`__DINOU_VFS__`), Dual-Bundle RSC/SSR worker orchestration (`rsc-engine.js` + `ssr-engine.js`), static asset fallback (`env.ASSETS`), and `CloudflareKVStorage` / `MemoryStorage`.

### 1.2. Three Module Bundlers (Development HMR & Production Builds)
1. **Esbuild**: Ultra-fast multi-pass RSC/SSR/Client bundling and live development mode (`dev:esbuild` / `build:esbuild`).
2. **Rollup**: Standards-based ESM bundling with custom RSC and Server Function plugins (`dev:rollup` / `build:rollup`).
3. **Webpack**: Full chunk-splitting and loader pipeline with live WebSocket HMR synchronization (`dev:webpack` / `build:webpack`).

### 1.3. Three Browser Engines (Playwright E2E)
1. **Chromium** (Blink / V8)
2. **Firefox** (Gecko / SpiderMonkey)
3. **WebKit** (Safari / JavaScriptCore)

### 1.4. Standalone Compiled Executables & Static Export Smoke Verification
In addition to the full Playwright browser matrix and the `-u` (unvendorized) Node AOT pipeline, CI continuously executes `tests/compile-and-export-smoke.mjs` (`compile-and-export-smoke` job) to verify:
1. **Static Site Export (`export-static`)**: Generates the standalone `out/` directory from `.dinou/dist2` and `.dinou/dist3` and verifies static HTML and manifest integrity.
2. **Compiled Node.js AOT Binary (`build:node:compile`)**: Packages `.dinou/node/server.mjs` via `bun build --compile`, spawns the native executable, and verifies HTTP `200 OK` responses across root and segmented routes.
3. **Compiled Bun Binary (`build:bun:compile`)**: Packages `.dinou/bun/server.js` via `bun build --compile`, spawns the native executable, and verifies HTTP `200 OK` responses.
4. **Compiled Deno Binary (`build:deno:compile`)**: Seeds Deno KV, packages `.dinou/deno/main.js` via `deno compile --unstable-kv`, spawns the native executable, and verifies HTTP `200 OK` responses.

## 2. Exhaustive Combinatorial Coverage in `e2e/example.spec.ts`

With over **7,000 lines of E2E specifications**, `e2e/example.spec.ts` covers both foundational framework capabilities and the **entire boolean cube ($2^3 - 1 = 7$ non-empty combinations)** of Dinou's three orthogonal rendering and caching axes:

1. **Horizontal Segmentation (HS)** (`layout.rsc` + `page.rsc` separation)
2. **Vertical Segmentation (VS)** (`<DinouCacheSlot>` Micro-ISR subtree caching)
3. **Partial Prerendering (PPR)** (`shell.html` static shell + streamed `<Suspense>` holes)

### 2.1. Complete E2E Verification Matrix

| Dimension / Rigorous Suite | Route in `dinou-e2e` | Key Edge Cases & Architectural Guarantees Verified |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Routing, SSR Streaming, SSG, ISR & ISG** | Multiple (`/t-*`) | Static, dynamic (`[slug]`), catch-all (`[...slug]`), optional catch-all (`[[...slug]]`), route groups (`(group)`), parallel routes (`@slot`), `error.tsx`, `not_found.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `validateParams`, `getStaticPaths`, `allowISG = false`, automatic Static-to-Dynamic bailout via `req.cookies`/`headers`/`query` proxies, and Dynamic-to-Static ISG recovery. |
| **Server Functions (`"use server"`)** | `/t-server-functions` & `/t-rigurous-*` | Top-level module directives, function-level `"use server"` directives in mixed modules, inline `"use server"` actions inside Server Components, direct imports into `"use client"` components, `FormData` & complex payload serialization, server-function redirects, manifest tree-shaking (excluding private helpers), and live HMR manifest synchronization without server restarts. |
| **1. Pure PPR** | `/t-ppr-rigorous` | Physical wire split between `shell.html` (`0ms TTFB`) and streamed `<template id="ppr-content-...">` chunks (`ppr-hole-N`), synchronous `<Suspense>` boundaries resolved in `shell.html` without consuming hole indices, nested `<Suspense>` deduplication inside outer holes, `React.memo` / `React.forwardRef` unwrapping, explicit child opt-out (`export const ppr = false`), flash-free client hydration, and query parameter forwarding to dynamic holes. |
| **2. Pure Vertical Segmentation (`<DinouCacheSlot>`)** | `/t-rigorous-cache-slot` | Subtree RSC caching with `tags`, clock-based TTL (`revalidate={N}`), and cache bypass (`revalidate={0}`); coalesced cold-start slot discovery; nested `<DinouCacheSlot>` hierarchies; serialization of `"use server"` action references passed as props into cached client subtrees; live client `refreshSlot(idOrTag)` preserving local `useState`, surviving round-trip soft navigations (`Page A -> Page B -> Page A` via `pageCache`), and refreshing unmounted slots in the background. |
| **3. Pure Horizontal Segmentation (HS)** | `/t-rigurous-hs` | Independent `layout.rsc` and `page.rsc` lifecycles; sibling soft navigation with `0` `/____rsc_layout____` requests and preserved layout client state; multi-level nested layouts; parallel `@slot` error boundary isolation; dynamic layouts with `validateParams` and `allowISG = false`; hierarchy escape hatches (`reset_layout` and `no_layout`); `router.refresh()` (page only) vs. `router.refresh({ layout: true })` (layout + page); surgical on-demand revalidation (`revalidatePage`, `revalidateLayout`, `revalidatePath`, `revalidateTag`) with `O(1)` lazy `index.html` re-composition; and independent clock-based TTL expiration (`revalidate = 1s`) for layouts vs. pages. |
| **4. Pairwise Synergy #1: PPR + `<DinouCacheSlot>`** | `/t-rigorous-sinergy` | `<DinouCacheSlot>` boundaries inside the static PPR shell (`inStaticShell: true`) vs. inside dynamic `<Suspense>` holes (`inStaticShell: false`); transactional `<Suspense>` effect frames discarding uncommitted slot writes when a sibling triggers `PprBailoutError`; differentiated invalidation (evicting only `slots/<id>` for dynamic-hole slots to preserve `0ms TTFB`, or non-destructively recomposing `shell.html` in place via `{ onlyRefreshSlots: true }` for static-shell slots without re-executing `page.tsx`). |
| **5. Pairwise Synergy #2: HS + `<DinouCacheSlot>`** | `/t-rigurous-hs-cache-slot` | Independent `<DinouCacheSlot>` boundaries across L1 layouts, L2 nested layouts, `@sidebar` parallel slots, and child pages; serialized reentrant revalidation queue (`enqueueRevalidation`) with monotonic timestamps preventing race conditions during concurrent `refreshSlot("*", { fresh: true })` bursts; out-of-order concurrent `refreshSlot()` last-write-wins protection for both mounted and unmounted slots; ancestor layout propagation; and independent clock-based TTL expiration across all 3 layers (layout, page, and slot). |
| **6. Pairwise Synergy #3: HS + PPR (No-CacheSlot)** | `/t-rigurous-hs-ppr` | Multi-level PPR layouts + PPR child pages + static opt-out pages (`ppr = false`); frozen static shells (`shell.layout.json` & `shell.page.json`) spliced with live `<Suspense>` holes (`spliceDynamicHolesIntoShell`) on both `router.refresh()` and `router.refresh({ layout: true })`; surgical `revalidatePage` composing with cached `layout.rsc`; surgical `revalidateLayout` and layout clock-TTL (`1s`) triggering lazy `shell.html` re-composition without re-executing child PPR pages; and inverse child page clock-TTL (`1s`) composing with cached long-lived layouts. |
| **7. Triple Synergy: HS + `<DinouCacheSlot>` + PPR** | `/t-rigurous-triple-sinergy` | All three subsystems operating simultaneously: L1 & L2 PPR layouts and PPR pages containing both static-shell `<DinouCacheSlot>` boundaries and dynamic `<Suspense>` holes wrapping `<DinouCacheSlot>` boundaries; 4-way surgical invalidation (`revalidateTag`, `revalidateLayout`, `revalidatePage`, `refreshSlot`); and independent clock-based TTL expiration across layout, page, and vertical slots with zero hydration mismatch on hard reload (`F5`). |

## 3. Executive Summary of Technologies & Capabilities Covered by Dinou

### 3.1. React 19 Full-Stack Architecture
- **React Server Components (RSC)**: Native Flight payload streaming (`layout.rsc`, `page.rsc`, `shell.rsc`, and `/____rsc_slot____/:id`) with full support for async Server Components, parallel data fetching, and Client Component module proxies.
- **Server Functions (`"use server"`)**: Zero-boilerplate RPC between Client Components and the server, supporting module-level, function-level, and inline Server Actions, `FormData` progressive enhancement, redirects, and automatic client manifest tree-shaking.
- **Selective SSR Streaming & Client Hydration**: Full-document HTML streaming with `<Suspense>` boundaries and React 19 client descriptor preservation in development and production.

### 3.2. Multi-Dimensional Rendering & Caching Engine
- **Automatic SSG, ISR, and ISG with Dynamic Bailout**: Build-time static generation with runtime Incremental Static Regeneration (TTL-based and on-demand) and Incremental Static Generation for new dynamic parameters. Automatic proxy-based detection of dynamic context reads (`req.cookies`, `req.headers`, `req.query`) transitions routes between static and dynamic rendering without manual configuration.
- **Partial Prerendering (PPR)**: Instant static shell delivery (`shell.html`) paired with single-response streaming of dynamic `<Suspense>` holes (`<template id="ppr-content-...">`) and pre-hydration DOM splicing.
- **Horizontal Segmentation (`layout.rsc` + `page.rsc`)**: Complete decoupling of layout and page rendering, props (`layout_functions.ts` vs. `page_functions.ts`), cache tags, and TTLs, featuring `O(1)` lazy HTML/PPR shell re-composition (`renderHtmlStream(layoutRsc, { pageRscStream })`) and granular client refreshes (`router.refresh()` vs. `router.refresh({ layout: true })`).
- **Vertical Segmentation (`<DinouCacheSlot>` / Micro-ISR)**: Component-level RSC caching, tag/TTL invalidation, and live in-place client subtree refreshing (`refreshSlot`) without unmounting or losing state in surrounding or nested Client Components.

### 3.3. Advanced File-System & Client SPA Router
- **Expressive Routing Conventions**: Static routes, dynamic segments (`[param]`), catch-all (`[...param]`), optional catch-all (`[[...param]]`), route groups (`(group)`), parallel routes (`@slot`), scoped error boundaries (`error.tsx`), loading boundaries (`loading.tsx`), custom 404 boundaries (`not_found.tsx`), and layout hierarchy escape hatches (`reset_layout` and `no_layout`).
- **Stateful SPA Navigation**: Client-side `layoutCache`, `pageCache`, and `slotOverrideCache` ensuring zero redundant network requests on back/forward or sibling navigations, with `<Link fresh>` support for explicit cache bypass.

### 3.4. HTTP API Routes, Context & Extensibility
- **API Route Handlers**: File-system HTTP endpoints (`route.ts` / `route.js` exporting `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`).
- **Request Context Isolation**: `AsyncLocalStorage`-backed `getContext()` providing safe access to `req` and `res` across deeply nested Server Components and Server Functions.
- **Pluggable Storage Architecture**: Unified `StorageAdapter` interface with built-in adapters for `FileSystemStorage`, `CloudflareKVStorage`, `DenoKVStorage`, `RedisStorage`, and `MemoryStorage`.

## 4. Future Stress-Testing Horizons (Optional)

All functional features and architectural interactions across Horizontal Segmentation, Vertical Segmentation (`<DinouCacheSlot>`), Partial Prerendering (PPR), and Server Functions are thoroughly covered. For future infrastructure-level stress testing, potential additions include:

1. **Multi-Instance Distributed `RedisStorage` E2E Cluster Test**: Running two concurrent Node.js worker instances backed by a shared Redis store to verify that surgical invalidations (`revalidateTag`, `revalidateLayout`, `revalidatePage`) triggered on Instance A are immediately reflected on Instance B.
2. **Network-Level `AbortController` Stream Cancellation on Rapid Soft Navigation**: While React 19 `startTransition` + `use(pagePromise)` already guarantees deterministic last-write-wins DOM commits on route navigation (and `DinouCacheSlotBoundary` + `getSlotJSX` enforce last-write-wins on out-of-order concurrent `refreshSlot()` calls, verified in `/t-rigurous-hs-cache-slot` Scenario 12), an optional future optimization could abort in-flight TCP streams on superseded soft navigations instead of letting them finish to warm `pageCache`.
